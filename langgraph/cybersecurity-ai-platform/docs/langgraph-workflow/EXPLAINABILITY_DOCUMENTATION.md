# AI Explainability Agent - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Explainability Agent provides transparent, audit-ready justifications for all AI-driven cybersecurity decisions. This agent is crucial for building trust, meeting regulatory compliance requirements, and enabling human oversight of automated security responses.

## Architecture Integration

### Position in Workflow
The Explainability Agent operates as **Step 6** in the enhanced LangGraph workflow:
1. Network Analysis → 2. Threat Analysis → 3. Compliance Check → 4. Incident Response → 5. Forensics Collection → **6. Explainability Analysis** → 7. Final Synthesis

### State Management
```python
explainability_report: Dict  # Added to SecurityState
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Decision Rationale Generation
**Purpose**: Provide human-readable explanations for AI decisions

**Output Structure**:
```json
{
  "overall_decision": "Risk score 9/10 triggered automated response",
  "key_factors": [
    "High network risk (9/10) due to critical asset targeting",
    "High threat severity (8/10) - Brute Force Attack",
    "1 compliance violations detected"
  ],
  "decision_tree": [
    "Network Risk ≥ 7 → Isolation Required",
    "Threat Severity ≥ 7 → Incident Creation",
    "Compliance Violations > 0 → Mandatory Reporting"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Risk Score Justification
**Purpose**: Break down risk calculations with mathematical transparency

**Network Risk Example**:
```json
{
  "network_risk": {
    "score": 9,
    "factors": [
      "Base risk: 5/10",
      "Critical asset target: +3",
      "High-risk protocol (SSH): +2"
    ],
    "calculation": "5 + 3 + 2 = 10/10"
  }
}
```

### 3. Action Reasoning
**Purpose**: Justify why specific security actions were recommended

**Action Justification Example**:
```json
{
  "action": "Immediate isolation required",
  "reasoning": "Network isolation prevents lateral movement and contains threat",
  "trigger": "Risk score ≥ 8 OR critical asset compromise",
  "compliance_requirement": "NIST CSF - Respond (RS.RP)"
}
```

### 4. Compliance Basis
**Purpose**: Map decisions to regulatory framework requirements

**Compliance Mapping**:
```json
{
  "frameworks_triggered": ["SOC2"],
  "violation_explanations": [
    {
      "violation": "Privileged Access Violation",
      "framework": "SOC2",
      "why_triggered": "Event matches Access Control Policy violation pattern",
      "regulatory_basis": "Service Organization Control 2 - Security and Availability"
    }
  ],
  "reporting_requirements": ["SOC2 control deficiency documentation"]
}
```

### 5. Confidence Analysis
**Purpose**: Assess certainty and identify uncertainty factors

**Confidence Metrics**:
```json
{
  "data_quality": "High - Complete event data available",
  "model_confidence": 0.9,
  "rule_certainty": "High - Clear policy violations detected",
  "human_validation": "Recommended for critical decisions",
  "uncertainty_factors": [
    "Attribution assessment has medium confidence",
    "Some network topology assumptions made"
  ]
}
```
