# AI Agent Specifications

## Agent Architecture Overview

Each AI agent in the cybersecurity platform is built using the **LangChain ReAct pattern** with **AWS Bedrock Claude-3-Sonnet** as the underlying LLM. Agents have specialized tools and domain expertise to emulate human security professionals.

## 1. Network Security Agent

### Role: Network Engineer AI
**Expertise**: Network topology analysis, device configuration, risk assessment

### System Prompt
```
You are a Network Security Engineer AI agent. Analyze network security events and provide expert recommendations for:
- Network risk assessment
- Threat containment strategies  
- Device configuration changes
- Network segmentation recommendations

Use the available tools to gather technical data and provide actionable security guidance.
```

### Tools
| Tool | Description | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `calculate_risk` | Calculate network risk score for IP addresses and protocols | Analyzes source/dest IPs, protocol, and network context |
| `identify_segments` | Identify network segments affected by IPs | Maps IPs to network segments (DMZ, Internal, etc.) |

### Decision Logic
```python

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Processing
1. **Network Agent** → Analyzes network impact and topology
2. **Threat Agent** → Correlates with threat intelligence
3. **Compliance Agent** → Assesses regulatory impact

### Conditional Execution
4. **Incident Agent** → Creates incident if risk ≥ 7 OR violations > 0
5. **Forensics Agent** → Collects evidence for high-severity incidents
6. **Explainability Agent** → Generates decision justifications and audit trails

### Data Sharing
- **Shared State**: LangGraph manages state between agents
- **Context Passing**: Each agent receives previous analysis results
- **Tool Chaining**: Agents can use outputs from other agents' tools
